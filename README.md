# Personnal Project: Analysis of traffic on Paris's Rental bike system

Hey there!

If you're reading this, this is a personal project I'm currently working on. I am a frequent user of Paris's rental bike system, called "Velib", and it always seems like the bikes are never there when I need them, which brought me to the question: Where are the f*cking bikes gone??

From that came the idea of finding out by myself the answer ot that question by analyzing the patterns of the bikes' localization over an entire week.


# Dev log
## Currently working on:

- Setting up a system to collect velib data 24/7 for a week
- Planning what insights I want to get from the data to answer my questions

## Past Tasks:
- Found a way to trigger the data collection process at regular time intervals
- Set up a script to create a dataset out of Smovengo's public API
