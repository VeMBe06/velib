# Personnal Project: Analysis of traffic on Paris's Rental bike system

Hey there!

If you're reading this, this is a personal project I'm currently working on. I am a frequent user of Paris's rental bike system, called "Velib", and it always seems like the bikes are never there when I need them, which brought me to the question: Where are the f*cking bikes gone??

From that came the idea of finding out by myself the answer ot that question by analyzing the patterns of the bikes' localization over an entire week.


# Dev log
## Currently working on:

- Planning what insights I want to get from the data to answer my questions
- Starting the Exploratory Data Analysis of the Velib dataset I created
- Starting to explore dataviz libraries to find which one will be best for my use case (currently
hesitating between Folium, Matplotlib and Plotly)

## Past Tasks:

- Downloaded the final csv file from my VM and shut everything down to optimize cost
- The virtual machine is done collecting data, after 700+ API calls I have a (supposedly) working dataset
- Set up a virtual machine on Google Cloud Platform to collect velib data 24/7 for a week
- Found a way to trigger the data collection process at regular time intervals
- Set up a script to create a dataset out of Smovengo's public API
